Implementation of CVSSv4 in Javascript

## CVSSv4's scoring looks weird...

Correct. It is very strange...it's essentially a scoring system based on a
statistical classifier/decision tree that is validated by experts in the room.
I'll also admit the public comment period seemed to not exist and was left to
the folks that were directly involved in FIRST CVSS working group discussions.
